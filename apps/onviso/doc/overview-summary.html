<h1>The onviso application</h1>

<p>The Onviso application wraps the OTP tool Inviso in an easy to use
application interface. Whereas Inviso provide the online tracing for small and
large systems; the Onviso wrapper provides default settings that suits most
setups and makes it user-friendly and re-usable. </p>

<p>Using only two functions it is possible to set up tracing across multiple
nodes and merge these in many possible combinations. Tracing can be reenabled if
the node under trace restarts. Additionally, for convenience when
using Onviso as an ad-hoc tracing tool, it is also possible to retrieve the
status of the recent traces run and the configuration that was used.</p>

<p>For merging the traces there are a number of options provided, the simplest of them
is to write every trace to a file in the order that it was generated. The
merge functionality can also be used to conduct property checking or profiling
the system that was traced. The possibilities are endless and only restricted
to the three funs that are passed to the merge function. </p>

<p>Moreover, it is possible to merge the same data multiple times with different
specifications, making it possible to check for various properties with every
merge.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>The following example demonstrates one of the simplest use-cases of
Onviso. The user specifies the patterns which can be either local or exported
functions of any module on any of the following nodes. A pattern is specified
as <code>{module, format, arguments, match_specification}</code>. Obviously
any number of patterns can be specified.</p>

<pre>
1&gt; onviso:trace([{heart, send_heart_beat, '_', []},
                 {io, format, '_', return}],
                ['server@linux', 'client@linux'],
                {all, [call]}).
{ok, 1}

2&gt; onviso:merge(1, void, void, shell).

...
{server@linux, Pid, call, {io, format, ["~p, ~p~", [jacques, derida]]}, {1250,585321,791722}}
...
{ok, 15}       
</pre>

<p>The <code>onviso:trace</code> function will always add the timestamp to all
 traces. Note that this is the timestamp from the machine where and when the
 trace was generated. Additionally, as seen in the second trace pattern
 defined above it is possible to use short-cuts for the most common match
 specifications; these are <code>return</code> and <code>caller</code>. If no
 match specification is required, it can be left empty with <code>[]</code>. </p>

<p>If desired one can, of course, write custom functions for merging. The
following example illustrates this. </p>

<pre>
3&gt; BeginFun = fun(_InitData) -&gt; 
                  case file:open("output.txt", [write]) of
                      {ok, FD} -&gt;
                           {ok, FD};
                      {error, Reason} -&gt;
                           {error, Reason}
                  end
              end,
#Fun&lt;erl_eval.6.13229925&gt;

4&gt; WorkFun = fun(Node, Trace, _, FD) -&gt;
                  io:format(FD, "~p &gt;&gt; ~p~n", [Node, Trace]),
                  {ok, FD}
             end,
#Fun&lt;erl_eval.4.105156089&gt;

5&gt; EndFun = fun(FD) -&gt;
                  file:close(FD)
            end,
#Fun&lt;erl_eval.6.13229925&gt;

6&gt; onviso:merge(1, BeginFun, WorkFun, EndFun).
{ok, 15}
</pre>

<p>In fact the above statements are identical to calling
<code>onviso:merge</code> as:</p>

<pre>
7&gt; onviso:merge(1, void, void, file).
{ok, 15}
</pre>

<p>There are a number of example merges provided in the
<code>onviso_example</code> module. Remember though that these only
demonstrate basic usage, it is, of course, possible to build significantly more
complex functions for evaluating the traces collected.</p>

<p><strong>What's in the <code>Trace</code> variable?</strong> 
It is possible to match directly against the incoming trace when merging. A
normal trace generated by the following pattern <code>{io, format, '_',
[]}</code> and the flags <code>{all, [call]}</code> will look like this:
 <code>{trace_ts, Pid, call, {Module, Function, Arguments},
 TimeStamp}</code>.</p>

<p> When using match specifications such as
 <code>return</code> and <code>caller</code>, variants of the trace above will
 be generated. Once again, it depends on the flags specified which means
 that if using the flags <code>{new, [send, 'receive']}</code> it will also
 look different. Below are some commonly used cases:
</p>

<pre>
%% Flags = {all, [call]}
% Pattern = {io, format, '_', return}
{trace_ts, Pid, call, {io, format, Arguments}, TimeStamp}
{trace_ts, Pid, return_from, {io, format, Arguments}, ReturnValue, TimeStamp}

% Pattern = {io, format, '_', caller}
{trace_ts, Pid, call, {io, format, Arguments}, {CallMod, CallFun}, TimeStamp}

%% Flags = {all, [send, 'receive']}
% Pattern = same as above
{trace_ts, FromPid, send, Message, DestinationPid, TimeStamp}

%% Flags = {all, [garbage_collection]}
% Pattern = same as above
{trace_ts, Pid, gc_start,[{old_heap_block_size,0},
                          {heap_block_size,233},
                          {mbuf_size,0},
                          {recent_size,0},
                          {stack_size,9},
                          {old_heap_size,0},
                          {heap_size,223}],
 TimeStamp}

%% Flags = {all, [proc]}
% Pattern = same as above
{trace_ts, Pid, exit, normal, TimeStamp}
</pre>

<p><code>TimeStamp</code> is in the format generated by
<code>erlang:now()</code>.</p>


<p><strong>Overload protection</strong> is used to regularly check the load of
a node and in case it reaches a threshold, suspend all tracing on that
node. The overload protection is specified as a fourth argument to the trace 
function. For example:</p>

<pre>
8&gt; onviso:trace(Patterns, Nodes, {all, [call]}, 
                [{overload, {{overload_handler, check},
                             15000,
                             {overload_handler, start, []},
                             {overload_handler, stop, []}}}]).
</pre>

<p>As it is not possible for either Onviso or Inviso to determine when a node
is overloaded one has to provide a module which checks this at the specified
interval. The <code>start</code> function returns a variable which is the only
argument that is passed to the <code>overload_handler:check/1</code> in every
iteration. Your <code>check/1</code> function must return either
<code>ok</code> or <code>{suspend, Reason}</code>. In the latter case,
Onviso will remove the trace patterns and flags set on all nodes. 
<code>stop</code> should ensure that the overload handler terminates gracefully.</p>

<p>The <code>onviso_example</code> module contains an example of checking the
current load of a node.</p>

<h2>User interfaces</h2>
<p>The user interfaces are intended to be used to facilitate the configuration of
Onviso. Whilst Onviso does reduce the complexity of Inviso, it can still be a
challenging task to set it up correctly, especially merging the traces
collected. Therefore the user interfaces provides a validation and trace case 
management mechanism. </p>

<p>Neither of the user interfaces are intended to offer complete control over
every aspect of Onviso since the merging possibilities are close to
infinite.</p>
<p>If one requires a special configuration, for example, comparing the
traces recorded, with external data, it is suggested that one should use the Onviso
API directly and build their own tool on top. </p>

<h3>Command client</h3>
<p>Suitable for terminal only clients when no X redirect is possible or
wxWidget is not available at the machine were the trace node is running.</p>

<p>Start by issuing the following command:</p>

<pre>
cli:start()
</pre>

<h3>wxWidget UI</h3>
<p>Still under development. </p>

<h2>Known issues:</h2>
<ul>
<li>It is not possible to redirect trace output to another node using a manual
handler fun.</li>
<li>Merging log from nodes running early R12 releases, a patch is needed due to an API change in the original <code>inviso and inviso_rt</code> applications: <br>
In <code>inviso_c.erl</code> an extra function close is needed into the log_rec_loop/5 function (from line 1111):
<pre>
        {Node,payload,Bin} -&gt;        % a chunk from a fetcher pre OTP-R12
            case lists:keysearch(Node, 1, RTs) of
                {value, {_Node, MRef, FType, FName, FD}} -&gt;
                    log_rec_payload(Node,MRef,FType,FName,FD,Bin,RTs,Replies),
                    log_rec_loop(Dest,Prefix,RTs,Replies,CMRef);
                false -&gt;
                    log_rec_loop(Dest,Prefix,RTs,Replies,CMRef)
            end;
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
