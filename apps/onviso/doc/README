Onviso 

In order to run the tests of provided in onviso_tests.erl one must first set up
two nodes, one called 'server' and the other 'client'. 

For the server node: 
	erl -sname server
	1> server:start().

For the client node: 
	erl -sname client
	1> client:init().

This should set the erlang cookie to 'inviso' and connect the two nodes to each other.

Happy hacking!
